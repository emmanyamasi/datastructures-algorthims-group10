This project implements a music streaming service using fundamental data structures:

Hash Tables: Efficiently store and retrieve songs by title or artist.
Linked Lists: Manage playlists in a dynamic and user-friendly manner, allowing song insertion, deletion, and reordering.
Queues: Provide a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer for streaming songs, ensuring smooth playback.
